Although you can get it by running profiler on SQL server. But this tool does it without the need for a SQL server.\r\n\r\n[Download Now](https://github.com/abtevrythng/FetchXML-to-SQL/releases/download/1.0.0/FetchXML2SQLv2.zip)\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nIt just parse the fetchXML file and creates SQL statements based on the input, just like we humans do when we manually convert fetchXML to SQL.\r\n\r\n### Whats missing from the first release\r\n1. Most of the operators such as this-month, next-month, last-year, etc. Planned to be included in the next release.\r\n2. Nested filters in fetchXML such as \r\n  <filter type=\"and\"><filter type=\"or\"><condition attribute=\"createdon\" operator=\"on-or-before\" value=\"@Enddate\" /><condition attribute=\"caseorigincode\" operator=\"ne\" value=\"3\" /><filter type=\"or\"><condition attribute=\"createdon\" operator=\"on-or-before\" value=\"@NEWEnddate\" /><condition attribute=\"caseorigincode\" operator=\"ne\" value=\"4\" /></filter></filter></filter>\r\n3. You tell me! Please add some issues to work on.",
